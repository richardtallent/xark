# XARK

## eXtensible Archival Record Knowledgebase

XARK is a proposed replacement for standards like GEDCOM, but geared toward researchers who are involved in detailed, source-based genealogy and other person-history work.

It is primarily designed for serialization in JSON and XMP, but can be serialized in a number of other ways, which will help make it "future-proof" as standards and popular formats change over time.

This is the documentation for the site, you can see the live site here: [https://xark.org](https://xark.org).

This is definitely a work in progress -- one of many irons in the fire for me. If you see bugs or areas of improvement, I'm open to ideas!
