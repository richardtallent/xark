# File Formats

File types come and go, so the XARK standard is focused more on how to _model_ the data than how to store or transmit it.

That said, there are two _canonical_ formats:

- [JSON](/format-json): for general use, such as local storage, on the web, such as in hosted files and APIs
- [XMP](/format-xmp): for embedding within images or other files that support XMP metadata

One could also use XML, YAML, semantically-tagged HTML, or a database. It may even be _possible_ to store XARK data in GEDCOM, though that would not be recommended.
